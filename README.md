# Clock Management System

## SDK USED
- MCUXpresso IDE
- VS Code

## References
- KLZ25 Reference Manual
- DS3231 Datasheet
- SSD1306 Datasheet
- Modified accordingly by understanding the working thorugh https://github.com/sdp8483/MSP430G2_SSD1306_OLED/tree/master/MSP430G2_SSD1306 for OLED display

## Notes
- Note: There may be more flicker in the video as video frame rate is quite high   

## Overview
- This project includes Real Time Display sensor implementation using FreeRTOS and OLED display.
- The drivers for DS3231 and I2c are written by me completely and FreeRTOS files were generated by MCUXpresso.
- First the init tasks run which initialises the modules or the peripheral and also clears the display.
- Then setting of date and time task runs which takes care of writing the correct data to the rtc and then suspends itself.
- After that the reading and printing of date and time runs followed by a error handler task which takes care if there is any issue with the RTC it will show error or clock error message onto the oled.
- These tow tasks runs in the round robin fashion and thus have automated error handler functionality.
- The complete project is based on bare metal project.
- The display drivers are capable of writing, clearing page by page and also complete clearing of the screen as well.  
- The i2c drivers are capable of writing, reading multiple bytes at a time.
- The DS3231 drivers contains functionality to write and read back and also to check the errors if there are any in the RTC while operation.
